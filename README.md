# Cloudflare IP Address Banning

*WARNING:* Do not use this script unless you know exactly what it does! It is just a rough sketch that isn't finished.

## About

This simple Python 3 script bans spammer IP addresses in bulk by reporting them to [Cloudflare's API](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html). It was written on Debian 9.

It reads from a text file that contains a list of IP addresses, one per line. ~~It logs results to a text file.~~

For now, this is just designed to bulk-ban IP addresses on Cloudflare. Maybe later it will have more functionality.

## Usage

1. In a Python 3 virtualenv: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Navigate to the directory where the script is.
1. Put IP addresses in a file called `banned_ips.txt`, one per line
1. Put API credentials into `cf_settings.py`. See the `cf_settings.example.py` file for an example.
1. Type `python cloudflare_ban.py` to run the script and ban the IPs.
1. The script will write output to the screen.
1. Check your firewall tools.
